# Sololearn Ruby
By Kevin Liu \
I am attempting to learn Ruby using the iPad version of Sololearn. I will be including course notes throughout this repository. The date next to the section is the date of completion (MM/DD/YYYY).

### Sololearn
SoloLearn is a free online resource for software engineers who are looking to learn a new programming language from scratch. They have tracks in 13 languages, including Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, and JavaScript.

### Ruby
Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection and just-in-time compilation.
